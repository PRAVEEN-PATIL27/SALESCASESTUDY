# SALESCASESTUDY
# ðŸ“Š Sales Performance Case Study

## Project Overview

This project is a **Data Analytics Case Study** developed using **R programming**. It uses the **Superstore Sales Dataset** (from Kaggle) to analyze how **Sales, Profit, and Discounts** vary across different regions. The goal is to discover patterns and relationships that help businesses optimize their sales and discounting strategies.

---

##  Objectives

* Identify trends in sales distribution
* Explore the effect of discounts on profit
* Analyze sales performance across different regions
* Build a **regression model** to predict profit

---

## Techniques Used

1. Data Collection (Kaggle dataset)
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, rounding, standardization)
3. Descriptive Statistics
4. Data Visualization (histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, boxplots)
5. Correlation & Regression Analysis

---

## Project Structure

* **Data Exploration**: Summary statistics, structure, dimensions of the dataset
* **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, reformatting, rounding
* **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizing Sales and Discount values
* **Visualizations**:

  * Histogram (Sales Distribution)
  * Scatterplot (Sales vs Profit + Regression Line)
  * Region-wise Sales (Bar Plot)
  * Profit by Discount Level (Boxplot)
* **Correlation Analysis**: Sales vs Profit, Discount vs Profit
* **Regression Model**: Predicting Profit using Sales and Discount

---

## Key Insights

* **West region** has the highest sales; **East region** has the lowest
* **Sales and Profit** are positively correlated â†’ more sales = more profit
* **Discount and Profit** are negatively correlated â†’ higher discounts reduce profitability
* Regression confirms: Sales increases profit, Discounts reduce profit

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Language**: R Programming
* **Libraries**: Base R (stats, graphics)
* **Dataset**: [Superstore Sales Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting/data)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `.R` file in **RStudio**
3. Download the dataset (`saless.csv`) from Kaggle and place it in the working directory
4. Run the scripts step by step

---

## Conclusion

* Sales growth directly contributes to profit
* Excessive discounts reduce profitability
* Businesses should **balance discount strategies** and focus on **high-performing regions** (West, Central) to maximize profit


 This case study demonstrates how **data cleaning, visualization, and regression** can provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
